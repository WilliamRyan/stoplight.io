    - author: Ben Colborn
      quote: >-
        What we're doing now, we simply could not have done before. It did take
        us a fair amount of time, even to support a single API, with our
        custom-built system. Now, given the number of APIs that we're
        supporting, and the number of APIs we have on the roadmap, it simply
        would not have been possible to entertain this idea. Without [Stoplight]
        we could not have on-boarded more than a single API.
