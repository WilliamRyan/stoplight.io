        Our team roughly saves 15-20 hours a week. It makes it quicker to write, and the review process is quicker as well because we can go in and everybody can see the edits.  We're pretty impressed with Stoplight as a whole.

        Stoplight provides a clean user interface and enables an engineering
        team to develop a compliant API with minimal difficulty. Other tools
        don't provide the same details, guard rails, and error validation that
        Stoplight provides.
